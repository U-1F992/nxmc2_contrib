# nxmc2_contrib

## Overview

The `nxmc2_contrib` library provides a straightforward way to build and execute commands conforming to the [NX Macro Controller v2](https://blog.bzl-web.com/entry/2020/01/20/165719) protocol[^1].

It includes the functionality for parsing raw byte sequences into structured command objects and executing commands with handlers. This makes it easy to develop NXMC2-compatible devices or software.

Written in the C programming language, this library is highly portable, making it easy to adapt across a variety of platforms.
